<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>With a background spanning retail and public accounting, I bring a unique blend of customer-centric problem-solving, 
  analytical precision, and adaptability to my work as a web developer. 
</p>

<p>My time in retail honed my ability to understand user needs, communicate effectively, and thrive in fast-paced 
  environments—skills that translate seamlessly into creating intuitive, user-friendly web experiences.
</p>

<p>Transitioning into public accounting further sharpened my attention to detail, logical reasoning, and ability to manage 
complex systems—qualities that are invaluable when writing clean, efficient code and debugging applications. Now, as a developer,
I combine these strengths with my passion for technology to build functional, visually appealing websites and applications.
</p>

<p>Whether working independently or collaborating with a team, I approach every project with curiosity, discipline, and 
a commitment to continuous learning—because great development, like great service, starts with understanding the bigger picture..
